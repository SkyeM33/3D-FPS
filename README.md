Project for MSCH-C220

A 3D first person game in which you navigate a weird, disorienting little world with collectables and a quest to complete.

## Implementation

Built using Godot 4.1.1<br>
Enemy models and some used and unused assets from Kenney.nl<br>
Coin sound sqeeeek_bell_ting2 by squeeek: https://freesound.org/people/sqeeeek/sounds/237105/<br>
I added multiple endings, collectable coins, a storyline, two enemies that can kill you if you get too close, a procedurally generated maze, a sound effect for the collectables, and a model that I made myself in blender.

## What Makes this a Game

You have a lot of agency in this world, you can wander around the strange barren landscape and choose to collect the coins or follow the quest given to you by a weird little cat. Even once you initiate the quest, there are multiple endings to get depending on how you choose to carry it out. The maze is randomly generated, making it a new challenge each time.

## References

No direct references, but I was inspired by ENA, particularly Temptation Stairway

## Future Development

I might work on the enemies more.
